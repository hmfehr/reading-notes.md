# [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)


### What is functional programming?
* a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
* So how do we know if a function is `pure` or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:

* It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as `deterministic`)
* It does not cause any observable side effects

### What are the benefits of a pure function?
* The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

### What is immutability?
* Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

### What is Referential transparency?
* This pure function will always have the same output, given the same input.
