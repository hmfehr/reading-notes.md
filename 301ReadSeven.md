### Who is Roy Fielding?
* smart dude that helped develope the first web servers. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
* because the computer only accesses  small chunk of the data needed to access global information if done in todays world it causes issues

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
* HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.
* Exactly. Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.
