1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	NoSQL
* SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. 	 
*  SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.	 
* SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.  	 
* SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
* SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.  


2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
* SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data 
* SQL databases have predefined schema 

3. Give a real world example.
* MySQL database is very popular open-source database. It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP, although it can be also stacked with nginx and server side javascripting using Node js. The following are some of MySQL benefits and strengths:

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
*  NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

5. Give a real world example.
* The movie storage in mongo data base

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
* NoSQL databases

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
* SQL databases are scalable.

1. What does SQL stand for?
* structured qurey lenguage

2. What is a relational database?
* A relational database (RDB) is a way of structuring information in 

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
* tables, rows, and columns.

4. What is a ‘schema’?
*  a schema is a list of logical structures of data.

5. What is a NoSQL database?
* A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

6. How does it work?
* NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
* MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically JSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
* While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
*  they don't support ACID
