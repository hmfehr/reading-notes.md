1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.

2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
You need to group your workforce members into roles with common access needs.  Avoid the temptation to have too many roles defined. Keep them as simple and stratified as possible.

3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
i would approch it with the knowlege that i now everyones role basses acsess and build from the highest granted acess down to the basic level of accsess

- Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
- Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
- Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role

3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
 is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).
Role-based access control is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.
