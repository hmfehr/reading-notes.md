# Event Driven Applications

## [Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit.  Event-driven programming. By registering event listeners we can actually reverse the flow of communication between our objects. Rather than on object needing to reach inside another object to trigger a function, our objects can just emit events and whichever objects are listening to those event will process it in the way they have been told to.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
