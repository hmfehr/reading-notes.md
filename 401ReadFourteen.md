## [Trees](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)

* Use an analogy


* Explain a detail in depth
- A Binary Tree is a non-linear data structure in which a node can have 0, 1 or 2 nodes. Individually, each node consists of a left pointer, right pointer and data element. A Binary Search Tree is an organized binary tree with a structured organization of nodes. Each subtree must also be of that particular structure.

* Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure


* Tutorial / walk through an example
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.


* Write a quiz


* Create a vocabulary/definition list
- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, `k = 2`.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

* Write a cheat sheet


* Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic


* Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them


* Build a map of the information


* Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic
