# [Readings: Node Ecosystem](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
* Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
* As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax.

3. What is Node used for?
* Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes.
