# Stacks and Queues

[Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html)

Use an analogy
- the plate on top was the last one added, and it's the first one removed. Meanwhile, a queue is First In First Out. Below, we see that Block C is again added to the end of the queue. But this time, Block A leaves: it was the first one in, so it's the first one out.

Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
