# Api Intergration

## [Review API Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/api-server/)

1. Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.
* Allow for Query String parameters for filtering
* 
2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:

1. Domain: `http://our-site.com`

2. `v3`
*  where # is the version number of our API
3. model name: `stuff`
* where ‘model’ is the name of the data model to operate on
4. id: `things`
*  where ‘id’ is the id number of a specific entity in the data model

3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.
the interface of the api is the behind the sceans of everything you do when using an application on any smart device.
