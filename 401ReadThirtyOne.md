# Context API


## [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

* What can React Context provide your app?
-  Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

* Why might we use Context?
- Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

* Why should we use it sparingly?
- Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.
