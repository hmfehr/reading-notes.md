# Readings: Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD


## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it.

2. Express the most popular `____`.
is the most popular node web framework

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling chain, in almost any order you like.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
Allows you to organize your code into manageable parts and  helps you manage your namespace, because only the variables you explicitly export are imported when you use a module.

## What is NPM?

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
8.19.3

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
npm i jshint


## What is TDD?

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
test are important so that as you are building out the code you are able to check the functionality of what you are doing.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing
the bennifits of testing are that if you test as you go it adds to a aspect of debugging and helps you find out areas that your code is broken.

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
Typical individual mistakes include:

* forgetting to run tests frequently
* writing too many tests at once
* writing tests that are too large or coarse-grained
* writing overly trivial tests, for instance omitting assertions
* writing tests for trivial code, for instance accessors

TEAM
* partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD
* poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time
* abandoned test suite (i.e. seldom or never run) – sometimes as a result of poor maintenance, sometimes as a result of team turnover


## CI/CD

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
helps keep the working code up to date with the master. 

2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
cdeliv develop to release at any time cdep deploy new fetures at any time

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
it acts as a notification system letting you know if deployments pass or fail
