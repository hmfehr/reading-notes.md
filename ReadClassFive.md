a way to embed an image to a string ex: `<img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" />`

* How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
You can give your table a caption by putting it inside a `<caption>` element and nesting that inside the `<table>` element. You should put it just below the opening `<table>` tag.
ex: `<table>
  <caption>
    Dinosaurs in the Jurassic period
  </caption>

  â€¦
</table>`

* Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
