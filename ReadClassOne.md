* TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).
* DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the address of the shop so you can access it.
* HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.
* Component files: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:
* Code files: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.
* Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.

*To begin, you'll need to answer these questions:*

- What is your website about? Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?
- What information are you presenting on the subject? Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
- What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?

- Sketch
- JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.
