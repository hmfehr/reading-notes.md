### Command Line.

**What is a command line**
- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

- line one will be the start of the command
- lines 2 and possible more will be the comand line arguments
- last line will ask to prompt again
- most terminals dont have numbers

**Code example:**

Line 1 - We ran pwd just to verify where we currently are.
Line 4 - We ran ls providing it with a relative path. Documents is a directory in our current location. This command could produce different results depending on where we are. If we had another user on the system, bob, and we ran the command when in their home directory then we would list the contents of their Documents directory instead.
Line 7 - We ran ls providing it with an absolute path. This command will provide the same output regardless of our current location when we run it.

*Definitions*
-pwd: Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

-ls: List the contents of a directory.

-cd: Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

-Relative path: A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.\

-Absolute path: A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

-file.exe: an executable file, or program.

-file.txt: - a plain text file.

-file.png: file.gif, file.jpg - an image.


### Linix is case sensitive
- Spaces are aloowed but also need to be reflected when running commands as to not confuse the system.
