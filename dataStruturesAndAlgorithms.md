## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
- We should always approach data and problems in such a way that not only allows us as devs to be efficent, but also in a way that makes it convient for engineers to access data without the hassle of memorization or repettive code. That can cause confussion and possibe mistakes on the passing. This is where Data Structures and Algorithims come in, this allows us to be able things uniformed and consise.


## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
- To avoid ifinite recursive call we can add a conditional with a return statement that will be met and stop the loop. Defining the end point
