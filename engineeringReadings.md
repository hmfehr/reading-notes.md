## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
- I bring the will to learn and to be able to take constructive critisism, and to be able to take the critisim and apply it to myself in a non arrogant way. I also always want to learn and i am coachable and teachable.


## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
The three things that i have really been sticking to treating this 401 cours like an actual work day and work enviroment. the first thing that i do when im stuch is and figure out if im stuck with a piece of something or if im stuck on the overall understanding. if Im stuck on the understanding then i will reach out to a ta "manager" meaning experience to help guied and teach through the issue. the second thing that i do is take a break, leave the room im in and stop looking at the computer but keeping the thought in the head to think of possible solutions. the third and final thing i do if im overly flustered i will communicate and ask for any help that im able to get to help and get passed the current roadblock.
