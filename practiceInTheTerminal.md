**The Command Line:** A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. 

**Basic Navigation:** PWD allows you to view what directory you are currently in, ls the gives a readout of all the items in that directory. you can use the "cd" command to change the directory and you can use the ".." to go back back out. this is refered to a relitive path where as an absolute path consists of actually writing out the path.

**More About Files:** At the end of the day everything that lives in linax is a file in the end. file.exe - an executable file, or program. file.txt - a plain text file. file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image. Terminals are case sensitive(computers are dumb 102 ex)  There is also a command to hide and find hidden files accessing it done by using '-a'.Quotes are used to use pick a specific item.

**Manual Pages:** he manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.
* `man <command>`
- Look up the manual page for a particular command.
* `man -k <search term>`
- Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
  
  
  **File Manipulation:** 
* mkdir
- Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.
* rmdir
- Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.
* touch
- Create a blank file.
* cp
- Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.
