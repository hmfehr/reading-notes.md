# CSS

* **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heet
* Styling of a website (makes it pretty)
* Can utilize hex code for coloring (**usally** a 6-didget set of numbers and letters)
* Utalizes curly braces/brackets
* You can select by class or ID

* HTML only puts what you type in the most basic layout, CSS alsows you to change everything to the way you want.


## what is CSS used for?

*Note*: A browser is sometimes called a user agent, which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside a computer system. Browsers are the main type of user agents we think of when talking about CSS, however, they are not the only ones. There are other user agents available, such as those that convert HTML and CSS documents into PDFs to be printed.

* CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
* **E.X. color and size** :
*  "h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

p {
    color: black;
}"

 
## CSS specifications

* All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs")
* As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to read to understand CSS. (good to know in the long term)


## Three ways to insert CSS

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS

* EXTERNAL CCS* - With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
* An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

*INTERNAL CCS* - An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.
